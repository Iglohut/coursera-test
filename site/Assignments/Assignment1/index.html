			Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.

			Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family (Brassicas) whose large flowering head and stalk is eaten as a vegetable.
